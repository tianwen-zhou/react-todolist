1. 页面样式 + 组件拆分 : JsX 中样式class 改为className, tyle内容部分需要两层大括号
2. 父子组件状态共享 及数据传递
   a.状态在哪里，操作状态的方法就在哪里
   b.父子组件都需要使用的状态，放到父组件当中
   c.子组件修改父组件都数据，通过父组件从props中传递方法给子组件
   d.父组件给子组件传递【数据】，通过props传递
   e.子组件给父组件传递【数据】，通过props传递，要求父组件提前给子组件一个函数
3. 页面事件处理
   a.注意defaultChecked方法和checked方法的区别，类似的还有defaultValue和value
   b.考虑各种交互场景中的边界情况，例如全部删除之后，总量的显示等



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
